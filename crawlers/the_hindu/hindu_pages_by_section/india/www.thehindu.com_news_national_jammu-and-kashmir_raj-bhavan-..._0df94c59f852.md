J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Friday (November 28, 2025) accused Raj Bhawan-appointed officers of carrying out demolition drives in Jammu and Kashmir to malign his government. 
“Officers appointed by the Raj Bhawan have started using bulldozers without seeking consent from the elected government. They did not even take the minister concerned into confidence. This seems like a conspiracy to defame, embarrass and undermine the administration chosen by the people,” said Mr. Abdullah. His comments were made in the context of recent demolition drives — one led by Jammu Development Authority in Narwal, where a journalist’s house was pulled down, and another ordered by Deputy Commissioner Ganderbal in Kangan.
The owners of the structures in Jammu and Kangan alleged that the officers did not follow the due legal process or serve notices before sending the bulldozers. 
Mr. Abdullah who was speaking at the party headquarters in Srinagar, also expressed concern over “selective targeting of a particular community” in these demolition drives. “A pick-and-choose policy has been adopted. Our government does not favour illegal constructions but why target a particular community? Officers posted by the Raj Bhawan are acting on instructions from elsewhere and are now targeting one community,” the Chief Minister said.
Mr. Abdullah said the appointments of chief executive officers (CEOs) and vice-chairmen come under the purview of the elected government, but these posts are filled by the Raj Bhawan. “Key field and revenue officials are being appointed without the approval of the elected government,” he added. 
The Chief Minister directed the JDA CEO to publish a list of all illegal occupants. “Then everyone will see what action is taken. Had our own officers behaved like this, we would have acted immediately. These officers work without any accountability to the elected government,” he said.
Meanwhile, the NC’s central working committee concluded its two-day meeting in Srinagar. It was chaired by NC president Dr. Farooq Abdullah. The committee passed a joint seven-point resolution, calling for ‘restoration of J&K’s special status’ and described it as ‘central to the aspirations and dignity of the people’. 
The NC also reiterated its demand for restoration of full statehood, “as repeatedly promised in the Parliament and acknowledged by the Supreme Court’s Constitution Bench.
Condemning the blasts at Delhi’s Red Fort and in Srinagar’s Nowgam, the NC called for high-level probes and accountability for any security lapses in the Nowgam incident. The party also voiced concern over the reported harassment of students, traders and other residents of J&K in different parts of the country. “Not every Kashmiri is a terrorist or a supporter of terror,” it stated.
Speaking at the event, Mr. Abdullah said, “During our tenure in J&K, no Pahalgam-style attack or blast like the one in Delhi occurred. Restore law and order to us; if we fail to manage it, you can take it back.”
