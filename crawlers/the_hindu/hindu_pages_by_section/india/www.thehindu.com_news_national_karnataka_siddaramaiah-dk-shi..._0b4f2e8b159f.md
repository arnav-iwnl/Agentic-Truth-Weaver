Though Siddaramaiah and D.K. Shivakumar have expressed their views criticising each other, they have been seen together at several official functions. File 
A day after Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and [his deputy D.K. Shivakumar used social media](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/word-power-is-world-power-says-dk-shivakumar-in-a-cryptic-post-on-x-on-power-sharing/article70329061.ece) to target each other amidst a leadership battle, both have decided to hold a breakfast meeting on Saturday (November 29) at the former’s residence here.
The Chief Minister said, “High command telephoned and told both of us to meet. Therefore, I invited him for a breakfast meeting.” 
The Chief Minister reiterated that there was no change in his stand. “I will listen to whatever high command says. He (Mr. Shivakumar) has also said that several times,” Mr Siddaramaiah said.

![](https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png)
When asked whether he would go to Delhi, Mr. Siddaramaiah said he would do so if invited.
In a damage-control exercise, the high command is believed to have instructed both leaders to hold a breakfast meeting.
As the Winter Session of the State legislature session would commence on December 8 in Belagavi, the meeting between two Congress leaders would also send a message to the rival BJP and JD(S) that all is well in the ruling dispensation. The Winter Session of Parliament begins on Monday (December 1).
[ Leadership change: Congress high command carefully weighing multiple options](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/leadership-change-congress-high-command-carefully-weighing-multiple-options/article70334725.ece)
![](https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png)
Though the two leaders expressed their views criticising each other, they attended the Cabinet meeting and several official functions of the government in the last few days.
Sources also said the breakfast meeting would also provide the high command some leeway to hold talks with the two leaders and buy some time to take firm decisions in the interest of the party.
The question is whether the breakfast meeting between two leaders would be just a photo opportunity or provide a common ground to make a temporary truce.
