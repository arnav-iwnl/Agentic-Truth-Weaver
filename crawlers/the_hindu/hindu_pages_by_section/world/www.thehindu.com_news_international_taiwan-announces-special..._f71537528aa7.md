[Taiwan’s](https://www.thehindu.com/tag/404-244/) President Lai Ching-te said on Wednesday (November 26, 2025) he will put forth a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including building a Taiwan Dome, an air defence system with high-level detection and interception capabilities, in the face of U.S. pressure for the island to increase its defence spending.

![](https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png)
The budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033, and comes after Mr. Lai already pledged to raise defence spending to 5% of the island’s GDP.
Currently, Taiwan has budgeted an increase in its defence budget to 3.3% for 2026, allocating TWD 949.5 billion ($31.18 billion).
Mr. Lai had previewed the announcement in an op-ed for the Washington Post on Wednesday (November 26), saying the special budget would be used to purchase arms from the U.S.

![](https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png)
Wellington Koo, Taiwan’s Minister of National Defence, said on Wednesday (November 26) that the $40 billion is an upper limit for the special budget and that it will be used to buy precision-strike missiles and for the joint development and procurement between Taiwan and the U.S. of equipment and systems.
