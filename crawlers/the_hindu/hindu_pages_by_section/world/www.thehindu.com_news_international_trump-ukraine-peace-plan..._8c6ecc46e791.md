U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan for ending the nearly four-year war emerged last week. File | Photo Credit: Reuters 
U.S. President [Donald Trump](https://www.thehindu.com/tag/donald-trump/) said on Tuesday (November 25, 2025) his plan to end the [war in Ukraine](https://www.thehindu.com/topic/russia-ukraine-crisis/) has been “fine-tuned” and he’s sending envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vladimir-putin-unpredictable-populist/article65217325.ece) and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll to meet with Ukrainian officials.
He suggested he could eventually meet with Mr. Putin and Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelenskyy](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/volodymyr-zelenskyy-twisting-in-the-whirlwind/article69279899.ece), but not until further progress has been made in negotiations.

![](https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png)
“I will be briefed on all progress made, along with Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles,” Mr. Trump added in the social media posting. 
“I look forward to hopefully meeting with President Zelenskyy and President Putin soon, but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages,” he said.
Mr. Trump spoke after U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll held talks on late Monday (November 24, 2025) and throughout Tuesday with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, to discuss the emerging proposal.
“The talks are going well and we remain optimistic,” Lt. Col. Jeff Tolbert, spokesman for the Army secretary, said in a statement.

![](https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png)
As the talks were taking place, Russia launched a wave of overnight attacks on Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, with at least seven people killed in strikes that hit city buildings and energy infrastructure. A Ukrainian attack on southern Russia killed three people and damaged homes, authorities said.
Mr. Trump’s plan for ending the nearly four-year war emerged last week. It heavily favoured Russia, prompting Mr. Zelenskyy to quickly engage with American negotiators. European leaders, fearing for their own future facing Russian aggression but apparently sidelined by Mr. Trump in drawing up the proposals, scrambled to steer the negotiations toward accommodating their concerns.
#### Kremlin says Steve Witkoff to come to Moscow next week 
Meanwhile, the Kremlin said on Wednesday (November 26, 2025) that U.S. President Donald Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, and a host of other key U.S. officials would come to Moscow next week for talks on a possible peace plan for Ukraine.
Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters on board Air Force One as he flew to Florida for the Thanksgiving holiday, said U.S. negotiators were making progress in discussions with Russia and Ukraine, and Moscow had agreed to some concessions.
A U.S.-based framework for ending the war, first reported last week, prompted fresh concerns that the Trump administration might be willing to push Ukraine to sign a peace deal heavily tilted toward Moscow.

![](https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png)
“As for Witkoff, I can say that a preliminary agreement has been reached that he will come to Moscow next week,” Yuri Ushakov, Putin’s foreign policy aide, told Russian state television’s top Kremlin reporter, Pavel Zarubin.
Mr. Ushakov said that in addition to Mr. Witkoff “a number of other administration representatives who are involved in Ukrainian affairs” would also come to Moscow. Mr. Ushakov also said that the leak of a telephone conversation between senior Kremlin and U.S. officials was an attempt to hinder the talks on a possible peace deal for Ukraine.
_Bloomberg News_ reported that Mr. Witkoff, in an October 14 telephone call with Mr. Ushakov, said they should work together on a ceasefire plan for Ukraine and that Mr. Putin should raise it with Mr. Trump. _Bloomberg_ said it had reviewed a recording of the conversation and published a transcript of the call. When asked why the call was leaked, Mr. Ushakov said: “To hinder, probably. It is unlikely this was done to improve relations.”
####  Long road to peace
Mr. Zelenskyy said late Monday (November 24, 2025) that “the list of necessary steps to end the war can become workable.” He said he planned to discuss “sensitive” outstanding issues with Mr. Trump.

![](https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png)
Rustem Umerov, a senior adviser to Mr. Zelenskyy, posted on X on Tuesday (November 25, 2025) that Mr. Zelenskyy hoped to finalise a deal with Mr. Trump “at the earliest suitable date in November.” 
Russian officials have been reserved in their comments on the peace plan. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Tuesday (November 25, 2025) that Moscow is in touch with U.S. officials about peace efforts.

“We expect them to provide us with a version they consider an interim one in terms of completing the phase of coordinating this text with the Europeans and the Ukrainians,” Mr. Lavrov said.
#### Trump says no firm deadline to reach peace deal
Mr. Trump backed away from his earlier Thursday deadline for Ukraine to agree to a U.S.-backed peace plan, saying “the deadline for me is when it’s over.”
Mr. Trump said U.S. negotiators were making progress in discussions with Russia and Ukraine, and Moscow had agreed to some concessions.
