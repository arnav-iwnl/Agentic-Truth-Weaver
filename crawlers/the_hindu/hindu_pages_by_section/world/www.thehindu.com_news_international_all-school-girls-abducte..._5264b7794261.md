The girls were abducted on November 17, and police at the time had said 25 were taken, but a statement on Tuesday (November 25, 2025) quoted President Bola Tinubu as saying that all 24 of the students who had been abducted were rescued. 
No details were released about the rescue mission.
“I am relived that all the 24 girls gave been accounted for. Now, we must put as a matter of urgency more boots on the ground in the vulnerable areas to avert further incidents of kidnapping,” the statement quoted Mr. Tinubu as saying.
