Indian nationals were among five people who died in a devastating fire in Brampton in Canada's Ontario province, according to the Consulate General of India in Toronto.
The mission said it has reached out to the affected family, and all required assistance is being extended to them.
"We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of lives of Indian nationals in the devastating fire incident in Brampton. The Consulate conveys its heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families and stands with them in this moment of immense grief," the Consulate General of India in Toronto said in a post on X on Thursday (November 27, 2025).
According to _CTV News_ , the fire broke out at 12 Banas Way, in the area of McLaughlin and Remembrance roads, at around 2.15 am on November 20.
Three women and a young toddler died in the fire, which is now being probed by Ontario’s Office of the Fire Marshal.
A pregnant woman who jumped out a window to escape the fire survived with injuries, but her unborn child did not.
The cause of the deadly blaze has not yet been determined.
Constable Tyler Bell said four people died at the scene: three women and a toddler. One of the people taken to the hospital was pregnant and went into emergency surgery to deliver the baby, but the baby has since died, he was quoted as saying by _CBC News_.
The constable said another four people in hospital have stabilised, though some remain in critical condition. One of them, a five-year-old boy, is "doing quite well," Mr. Bell said.
Mayor Patrick Brown alleged last week that the home was owned by an "absentee landlord" who had a history of compliance issues with the basement unit.
Mr. Bell did not provide details on the home's occupancy, and said the main priority for investigators at the moment is managing victims and witnesses.
