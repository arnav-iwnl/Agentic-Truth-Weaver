Several Opposition leaders and party workers, including former CPI(M) MLA Amitava Datta, were injured in the incidents. Both parties have blamed the ruling BJP for the events that have occurred in the wake of days of violence involving cadres of the BJP and its alliance partner, Tipra Motha. Party offices and residences were targeted in the earlier incidents. ****Also read:[Tipra Motha Chief warns Minister amid recent political violence in Tripura](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tripura/tipra-motha-chief-warns-minister-amid-recent-political-violence-in-tripura/article70315501.ece)**** Senior leaders of Congress alleged that the attacks on Opposition party offices and ranks aimed at diverting attention from the continuing tension between the BJP and its coalition partners. They also lashed out at police for failing to curb the incidents and allowing perpetrators a free run. The Congress district office at Dharmanagar, headquarters of north Tripura district, was severely damaged by the attackers on Wednesday (November 26, 2025). Parts of the office were also set on fire. Former CPI(M) MLA Amitava Datta and another senior leader were injured during a party programme in another attack by alleged BJP workers in Dharmanagar. They are currently undergoing treatment at GBP Hospital in Agartala. After Congress, the CPI(M) also held street protests against the attacks. “The Chief Minister cannot ignore his responsibility for the series of political violence in the state,” former Minister and senior CPI(M) leader Manik Dey told journalists during one of the protests on Friday (November 28, 2025). He said that the Chief Minister had not condemned the violence and targeted attacks. He said the recent incidents are “entirely politically motivated.” Published - November 29, 2025 05:50 am IST Read Comments * Copy link * Email * Facebook * Twitter * Telegram * LinkedIn * WhatsApp *
